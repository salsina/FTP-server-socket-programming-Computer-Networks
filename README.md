File transfering between client and server using socket programming

In this project, there exists two files: client.cpp and server.cpp

The goal is to read the informations of users from config.json and set them into our database

After that any user can log in to its account. Any user as client has some options to do like creating files, deleting files, deleting directories, pwd, changing current directory, downloading files and ...

For the file transfering part, the server checks for the file and sends the data inside it to the client.

All kinds of errors are handled in this process.
